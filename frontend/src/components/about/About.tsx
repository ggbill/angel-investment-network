                                        <p><b>Favourite Love Song?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT1iDKkZNYU&ab_channel=SuperChannel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">You to me are everything (The Real Thing)</a></b></p>
                                        <p>I‚Äôm Norman. Compared to my colleagues, I‚Äôm a relative newbie to financial services having cut my teeth as a senior fundraiser in the arts and culture sector. However, I‚Äôve been here a while now and I‚Äôve helped complete over 50 acquisition deals since making the switch. I‚Äôm a communicator and chances are that it‚Äôll be me you speak to first. I hope you‚Äôll like it. I like to think I get people and I understand business so I‚Äôm looking forward to a good conversation.</p>

                        <p>Look, we don‚Äôt do this for free. Weddings cost money. But we think that the expense becomes easier to swallow when everyone‚Äôs happy. That‚Äôs why our charges are based on success.</p>
                        <p>We think that‚Äôs fair. Call us and we‚Äôll talk you through it.</p>
